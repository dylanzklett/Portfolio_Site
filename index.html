				Communication is vital. I may be the one that builds your app, your website, but the idea belongs to you. It's my job to make sure not only that it never gets lost, but that it shines. Let's work together to make something great.

				It's all one big puzzle. Every problem has a solution. Every question has an answer. I find joy in unlocking each new answer that comes with each new conundrum. I strive to learn something new with every single project.
