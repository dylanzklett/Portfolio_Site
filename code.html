			As a response to the increasingly distant and frustrating relationship between the individual and the political process, Citzens Empowered was formed to help promote sustainable government and governing practices. 
		</p>
		<p class="ce-info2">
			Designed using Firebase and Insightly, the website serves to gather, organize, and inform voters and would-be voters as to what problems the modern political climate presents, and how they can best contribute to them in a meaningful, personal, powerful way.

			Designed to meet the needs of a myriad of markets wherein currency is not always the default medium of exchange, Kollector is a networking and marketing platform built to be flexible enough to adapt to multiple specialty demographics. Initially developed for use within  luxury collectible markets like trading cards, comic books, collectible firearms, and other specialty items, the engine fueling the app is robust enough to be adapted towards stocks, freelance work, or any other demographic where one good is exchanged for another without the direct involvement of legal tender. 
		</p>
		<p class="k-info">
			This app was built purely using Ruby on Rails, utilizing AJAX and SASS to assist in manipulating the front end.
